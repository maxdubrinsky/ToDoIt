# ToDoIt
Welcome to ToDoIt, a comprehensive to-do and list management application. Currently, functionality is limited due to our in-development state, but we hope to be up and running very soon. Any and all usage information for this application will be posted here for convenience and logistical purposes, so please check here frequently for updates.
# Usage
<b>Task List</b>
<p>On the left side of the window, you can see a list of tasks currently pending. Although there are tasks there, they are tests as server-client communication has not yet been completed.</p>
<b>Adding tasks</b>
<p>Tasks are added by selecting the 'Add Task' button in the window. This will open a new, smaller window where you can input all the great information you might need with a task, such as name, description, start and end date. At the moment, this does nothing.</p>
<b>Viewing Tasks</b>
<p>To view a task and all of the information associated with it, simply select the task you want and press the 'View Task' button. This will open a window with a read-only view of the task. This feature is not yet implemented.</p>
<b>Editing Tasks</b>
<p>You can edit a task by selecting the 'Edit Task' button with the task you would like to modify selected. A task is selected by clicking on it, and when the button is pressed, it will open up a window similar to the add task where you can modify anything associated with the task. This feature is currently not implemented.</p>
<b>Removing Tasks</b>
<p>If you wish to remove a task, possibly after completion/procrastination, just select the task you wish to remove and hit the 'Remove Task' button (original, yes). This feature is currently not implemented (broken record, I know).</p>
